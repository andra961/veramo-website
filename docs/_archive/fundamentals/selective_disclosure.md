Selective Disclosure is a message type and communication protocol built on the fundamental principles of enabling entities to control their data sharing.

A Selective Disclosure Request (SDR) is a request for the holder to share some verifiable data about themselves. The holders, who are usually but not limited to humans, can selectively share data with a verifier in order to obtain some value in return. An SDR message contains a basic query format to specify the data being requested and some validation rules.

The holder can review the requested data and selectively share or present verifiable credentials according to the value that it represents in your apps. This [W3C standard presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations) format is called a [Verifiable Presentation.](/docs/basics/presentations)
