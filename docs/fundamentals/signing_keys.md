title: Signing & Keys
---

Digital signatures using keys pairs are very common place today. Using another real world analogy, we can think how we use our car keys. If you are in possession of a car key then it is assumed you are the owner or have permission to use the car. You protect your car keys as they protect something of value. Anyone can look at your car and see some visual information about it and also some information written on it like tax and insurance but they canâ€™t use that information to drive your car. This is analogous to a public key.

When you sign a piece of data digitally you are using a private key. Your public and private keys have a very specific relationship. Your public key will be shared and can be used to verify your signature created using your private key.
