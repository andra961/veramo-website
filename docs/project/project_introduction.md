The Veramo Framework was initially released by the Identity Team within the [Consensys Mesh](https://mesh.xyz/).
It is the result of years of experience within the Self-Sovereign Identity space and represents a complete rewrite
of many elements of the previous uPort Identity Framework and Libraries. The core architecture of Veramo was designed
to be flexible and forward-looking in order to be able to support the quick iterations within the SSI space.
